                Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
                Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).<sup>[1]</sup> Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source
                of
                food
                (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

            <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
            <p>
                Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and
                even
                animals as large as lizards, small snakes, or young mice. The average chicken may live for five to ten
                years,
                depending on the breed.The world's oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age
                of
                16
                years according to the Guinness World Records.

            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <h3>Social behaviour</h3>
            <p>
                Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
                incubation
                of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
                "pecking
                order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens
                or
                roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
                established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and
                injury.
